## Project Overview

Stroke prediction is a critical healthcare application that can help medical professionals identify individuals at risk of stroke. This project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and comparison of multiple classification algorithms. The primary goal is to build a reliable predictive model for stroke occurrence.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about various individuals and their health attributes. It includes attributes such as age, gender, hypertension status, average glucose level, body mass index (BMI), and more. The dataset was obtained from [source link].

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering
- Model selection and training
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Ensemble techniques: Voting, Bagging, Stacking
- Detailed classification metrics analysis

Usage

Prepare your dataset and place it in the data/ directory.
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
Experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to find the best model for stroke prediction.
Results

The project has evaluated and compared several classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and ensemble techniques such as Voting, Bagging, and Stacking.

The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 100% and a 0% type 2 error rate on the test set using the Stacking technique.
